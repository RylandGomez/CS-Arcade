# CS-Arcade
WORK IN PROGRESS

My solutions for CodeSignal Arcade exercises, commented with explanations and alternate solutions provided by myself or derived from other CodeSignal users' solutions.
Any feedback, improvements, or novel additions to the repository and its contained files are more than welcome!
All code is written in Python 3.
Prompts are omitted out of respect for CodeSignal.
Answers are given for educational purposes only.
I recommend attempting to solve solutions yourself, and referencing the .py files afterwards to cement understanding and explore alternative ideas to broaden your educational scope!
